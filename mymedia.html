        <p>Here, There and Everywhere by Sudha Murthy is Simple yet beautiful.
        Written in simple language. Book is filled with lot of positiveness. Very inspiring and touching book. Glad i read it.
        Book changes the way you see the world. Everytime you don't need money for good work. Just believing in good deeds is enough.</p>
        <h1>Akshitha Katyaini Reddy Akkireddy</h1>
        <p>Sakhi is a tale of two lovers, rather a newly married couple caught in a love transition.
        The story of boy meets girl and falling head over heels in love, is not new to the movie industry.
        However, the depiction of the story is what makes all the difference.</p>
